-- By definition, a view is a named query stored in the database catalog.
-- Note that a view does not physically store the data. When you issue the SELECT statement against the view, MySQL executes the underlying query specified in the viewâ€™s definition and returns the result set. For this reason, sometimes, a view is referred to as a virtual table.
