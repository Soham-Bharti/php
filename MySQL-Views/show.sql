-- MySQL Show View â€“ Using SHOW FULL TABLES statement
-- MySQL treats the views as tables with the type 'VIEW'. Therefore, you can use the SHOW FULL TABLES statement to display all views in the current database as follows:

-- SHOW FULL TABLES 
-- WHERE table_type = 'VIEW';

-- Because the SHOW FULL TABLES statement returns both tables and views, we need to add a WHERE clause to obtain views only.

-- If you want to show all views in a specific database, you can use the FROM or IN clause in the SHOW FULL TABLES statement:

-- SHOW FULL TABLES
-- [{FROM | IN } database_name]
-- WHERE table_type = 'VIEW';

SHOW FULL TABLES IN sys 
WHERE table_type='VIEW';
